Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
All good things must come to an end
A picture is worth a thousand words
A watched pot never boils
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Do not bite the hand that feeds you
Do not count your chickens before they hatch
Do not judge a book by its cover
Do not put all of your eggs in one basket
Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Do not put too many irons in the fire
Fortune favors the bold
Good things come to those who wait
Honesty is the best policy
Knowledge is power
Laughter is the best medicine
No man is an island
Practice makes perfect
The early bird gets the worm
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
The grass is always greener on the other side
The pen is mightier than the sword
There is no place like home
There is no such thing as a free lunch
There is no time like the present
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Time is money
Two heads are better than one
Two wrongs do not make a right
Strike while the iron is hot
Many hands make light work
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Rome was not built in a day
Still waters run deep
Curiosity killed the cat
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest
Learn to walk before you run
First things first
Always put your best foot forward
A rolling stone gathers no moss
A stitch in time saves nine
